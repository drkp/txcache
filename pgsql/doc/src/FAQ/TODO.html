<p>This list contains all known PostgreSQL bugs and feature requests. If<br/>
you would like to work on an item, please read the Developer's FAQ<br/>
first.
</p>
<h1><a name="section_2">Administration</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Allow major upgrades without dump/reload, perhaps using pg_upgrade 
  [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?pg_upgrade">pg_upgrade</a>]
  </li><li>Check for unreferenced table files created by transactions that were
  in-progress when the server terminated abruptly
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-06/msg00096.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-06/msg00096.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Allow administrators to safely terminate individual sessions either
  via an SQL function or SIGTERM 
<p>  Lock table corruption following SIGTERM of an individual backend
  has been reported in 8.0.  A possible cause was fixed in 8.1, but
  it is unknown whether other problems exist.  This item mostly
  requires additional testing rather than of writing any new code.
  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00174.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00174.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>%Set proper permissions on non-system schemas during db creation
<p>  Currently all schemas are owned by the super-user because they are
  copied from the template1 database.
</p>
  </li><li>Support table partitioning that allows a single table to be stored
  in subtables that are partitioned based on the primary key or a WHERE
  clause
  </li><li>Add function to report the time of the most recent server reload
  </li><li>Allow statistics collector information to be pulled from the collector
  process directly, rather than requiring the collector to write a
  filesystem file twice a second?
  </li><li>Allow log_min_messages to be specified on a per-module basis
<p>  This would allow administrators to see more detailed information from
  specific sections of the backend, e.g. checkpoints, autovacuum, etc.
  Another idea is to allow separate configuration files for each module,
  or allow arbitrary SET commands to be passed to them.
</p>
  </li><li>Simplify ability to create partitioned tables
<p>  This would allow creation of partitioned tables without requiring
  creation of rules for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, and constraints for
  rapid partition selection.  Options could include range and hash
  partition selection.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow auto-selection of partitioned tables for min/max() operations
  </li><li>Allow more complex user/database default GUC settings
<p>  Currently, ALTER USER and ALTER DATABASE support per-user and
  per-database defaults.  Consider adding per-user-and-database
  defaults so things like search_path can be defaulted for a 
  specific user connecting to a specific database.
</p>
  </li><li>Improve replication solutions
  <ul>
    <li>Load balancing
<p>          You can use any of the master/slave replication servers to use a
          standby server for data warehousing. To allow read/write queries to
          multiple servers, you need multi-master replication like pgcluster.
</p>
    </li><li>Allow replication over unreliable or non-persistent links
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Configuration files
  <ul>
    <li>Allow commenting of variables in postgresql.conf to restore them
          to defaults
<p>          Currently, if a variable is commented out, it keeps the
          previous uncommented value until a server restarted.
          <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg01481.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg01481.php</a>
</p>
    </li><li>Allow pg_hba.conf to specify host names along with IP addresses
<p>          Host name lookup could occur when the postmaster reads the
          pg_hba.conf file, or when the backend starts.  Another
          solution would be to reverse lookup the connection IP and
          check that hostname against the host names in pg_hba.conf.
          We could also then check that the host name maps to the IP
          address.
</p>
    </li><li>%Allow postgresql.conf file values to be changed via an SQL
          API, perhaps using SET GLOBAL
    </li><li>Allow the server to be stopped/restarted via an SQL API
    </li><li>Issue a warning if a change-on-restart-only postgresql.conf value
          is modified  and the server config files are reloaded
    </li><li>Mark change-on-restart-only values in postgresql.conf
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Tablespaces
  <ul>
    <li>Allow a database in tablespace t1 with tables created in
          tablespace t2 to be used as a template for a new database created
          with default tablespace t2
<p>          All objects in the default database tablespace must have default
          tablespace specifications. This is because new databases are
          created by copying directories. If you mix default tablespace
          tables and tablespace-specified tables in the same directory,
          creating a new database from such a mixed directory would create a
          new database with tables that had incorrect explicit tablespaces.
          To fix this would require modifying pg_class in the newly copied
          database, which we don't currently do.
</p>
    </li><li>Allow reporting of which objects are in which tablespaces
<p>          This item is difficult because a tablespace can contain objects
          from multiple databases. There is a server-side function that
          returns the databases which use a specific tablespace, so this
          requires a tool that will call that function and connect to each
          database to find the objects in each database for that tablespace.
</p>
    </li><li>%Add a GUC variable to control the tablespace for temporary objects
          and sort files
<p>          It could start with a random tablespace from a supplied list and
          cycle through the list.
</p>
    </li><li>Allow WAL replay of CREATE TABLESPACE to work when the directory
          structure on the recovery computer is different from the original
    </li><li>Allow per-tablespace quotas
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)
  <ul>
    <li>Allow a warm standby system to also allow read-only statements
            [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?pitr">pitr</a>]
<p>            This is useful for checking PITR recovery.
</p>
    </li><li>%Create dump tool for write-ahead logs for use in determining
            transaction id for point-in-time recovery
    </li><li>Allow the PITR process to be debugged and data examined
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_3">Monitoring</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Allow server log information to be output as INSERT statements
<p>  This would allow server log information to be easily loaded into
  a database for analysis.
</p>
  </li><li>%Add ability to monitor the use of temporary sort files
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_4">Data Types</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Improve the MONEY data type
<p>  Change the MONEY data type to use DECIMAL internally, with special
  locale-aware output formatting.
  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2005-08/msg01432.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2005-08/msg01432.php</a>
  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg01107.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-09/msg01107.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Change NUMERIC to enforce the maximum precision
  </li><li>Add NUMERIC division operator that doesn't round?
<p>  Currently NUMERIC <u>rounds</u> the result to the specified precision.  
  This means division can return a result that multiplied by the 
  divisor is greater than the dividend, e.g. this returns a value &gt; 10:
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>    SELECT (10::numeric(2,0) / 6::numeric(2,0))::numeric(2,0) * 6;
</p>
<p>  The positive modulus result returned by NUMERICs might be considered<br/>
  inaccurate, in one sense.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix data types where equality comparison isn't intuitive, e.g. box
  </li><li>Allow user-defined types to specify a type modifier at table creation
  time
  </li><li>Allow user-defined types to accept 'typmod' parameters
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-08/msg01142.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-08/msg01142.php</a>

</p>
  </li><li>Add support for public SYNONYMs
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-03/msg00519.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-03/msg00519.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Fix CREATE CAST on DOMAINs
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-05/msg00072.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-05/msg00072.php</a>

</p>
  </li><li>Add Globally/Universally Unique Identifier (GUID/UUID)
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-09/msg00209.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-09/msg00209.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Add support for SQL-standard GENERATED/IDENTITY columns
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-07/msg00543.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-07/msg00543.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Support a data type with specific enumerated values (ENUM)
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00979.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-08/msg00979.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Improve XML support
<p>  <a href="http://developer.postgresql.org/index.php/XML_Support">http://developer.postgresql.org/index.php/XML_Support</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Dates and Times
  <ul>
    <li>Allow infinite dates and intervals just like infinite timestamps
    </li><li>Merge hardwired timezone names with the TZ database; allow either 
          kind everywhere a TZ name is currently taken
    </li><li>Allow TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE to store the original timezone
          information, either zone name or offset from UTC [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?timezone">timezone</a>]
<p>          If the TIMESTAMP value is stored with a time zone name, interval 
          computations should adjust based on the time zone rules.
</p>
    </li><li>Fix SELECT '0.01 years'::interval, '0.01 months'::interval
    </li><li>Add a GUC variable to allow output of interval values in ISO8601 
          format
    </li><li>Improve timestamptz subtraction to be DST-aware
<p>          Currently, subtracting one date from another that crosses a
          daylight savings time adjustment can return '1 day 1 hour', but
          adding that back to the first date returns a time one hour in
          the future.  This is caused by the adjustment of '25 hours' to
          '1 day 1 hour', and '1 day' is the same time the next day, even
          if daylight savings adjustments are involved.
</p>
    </li><li>Fix interval display to support values exceeding 2^31 hours
    </li><li>Add overflow checking to timestamp and interval arithmetic    
    </li><li>Add ISO INTERVAL handling
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>                  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-01/msg00250.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-01/msg00250.php</a><br/>
                  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2006-04/msg00248.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2006-04/msg00248.php</a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support ISO INTERVAL syntax if units cannot be determined from
                  the string, and are supplied after the string
<p>                  The SQL standard states that the units after the string
                  specify the units of the string, e.g. INTERVAL '2' MINUTE
                  should return '00:02:00'. The current behavior has the units
                  restrict the interval value to the specified unit or unit
                  range, INTERVAL '70' SECOND returns '00:00:10'.
</p>
<p>                  For syntax that isn't uniquely ISO or PG syntax, like '1' or
                  '1:30', treat as ISO if there is a range specification clause,
                  and as PG if there no clause is present, e.g. interpret '1:30'
                  MINUTE TO SECOND as '1 minute 30 seconds', and interpret
                  '1:30' as '1 hour, 30 minutes'.
</p>
<p>                  This makes common cases like SELECT INTERVAL '1' MONTH
                  SQL-standard results. The SQL standard supports a limited
                  number of unit combinations and doesn't support unit names in
                  the string. The PostgreSQL syntax is more flexible in the
                  range of units supported, e.g. PostgreSQL supports '1 year 1
                  hour', while the SQL standard does not.
</p>
  </li><li>Add support for year-month syntax, INTERVAL '50-6' YEAR TO MONTH
  </li><li>Interpret INTERVAL '1 year' MONTH as CAST (INTERVAL '1 year' AS
                  INTERVAL MONTH), and this should return '12 months'
  </li><li>Round or truncate values to the requested precision, e.g.
                  INTERVAL '11 months' AS YEAR should return one or zero
  </li><li>Support precision, CREATE TABLE foo (a INTERVAL MONTH(3))
  <ul>
    <li>Arrays
    <ul>
      <li>Delay resolution of array expression's data type so assignment
          coercion can be performed on empty array expressions
      </li><li>Add support for arrays of domains
      </li><li>Add support for arrays of complex types
    </li></ul>
    </li><li>Binary Data
    <ul>
      <li>Improve vacuum of large objects, like /contrib/vacuumlo?
      </li><li>Add security checking for large objects
      </li><li>Auto-delete large objects when referencing row is deleted
<p>          /contrib/lo offers this functionality.
</p>
      </li><li>Allow read/write into TOAST values like large objects
<p>          This requires the TOAST column to be stored EXTERNAL.
</p>
      </li><li>Add API for 64-bit large object access
<p>          <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-09/msg00781.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-09/msg00781.php</a>
</p>
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_5">Functions</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Allow INET subnet tests using non-constants to be indexed
  </li><li>%Add pg_get_acldef(), pg_get_typedefault(), pg_get_attrdef(),
  pg_get_tabledef(), pg_get_domaindef(), pg_get_functiondef()
<p>  These would be for application use, not for use by pg_dump.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow to_date() and to_timestamp() accept localized month names
  </li><li>Add missing parameter handling in to_char()
</li></ul>
<p>        <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-12/msg00948.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-12/msg00948.php</a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow functions to have a schema search path specified at creation time
  </li><li>Allow substring/replace() to get/set bit values
  </li><li>Allow to_char() on interval values to accumulate the highest unit
  requested
<p>  Some special format flag would be required to request such
  accumulation.  Such functionality could also be added to EXTRACT. 
  Prevent accumulation that crosses the month/day boundary because of
  the uneven number of days in a month.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to_char(INTERVAL '1 hour 5 minutes', 'MI') =&gt; 65

    </li><li>to_char(INTERVAL '3 years 5 months','MM') =&gt; 41
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Add ISO day of week format 'ID' to to_char() where Monday = 1
  </li><li>Add a field 'isoyear' to extract(), based on the ISO week
  </li><li>Add SPI_gettypmod() to return the typemod for a TupleDesc
  </li><li>Allow inlining of set-returning functions
  </li><li>Allow SQL-language functions to return results from RETURNING queries
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_6">Multi-Language Support</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Add NCHAR (as distinguished from ordinary varchar),
  </li><li>Allow locale to be set at database creation
<p>  Currently locale can only be set during initdb.  No global tables have
  locale-aware columns.  However, the database template used during
  database creation might have locale-aware indexes.  The indexes would
  need to be reindexed to match the new locale.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow encoding on a per-column basis optionally using the ICU library:
<p>  Right now only one encoding is allowed per database.  [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?locale">locale</a>]

  </li><li>Support multiple simultaneous character sets, per SQL92
  </li><li>Improve UTF8 combined character handling?
  </li><li>Add octet_length_server() and octet_length_client()
  </li><li>Make octet_length_client() the same as octet_length()?
  </li><li>Fix problems with wrong runtime encoding conversion for NLS message files
  </li><li>Add URL to more complete multi-byte regression tests

</p>
  </li><li>Set client encoding based on the client operating system encoding
<p>  Currently client_encoding is set in postgresql.conf, which
  defaults to the server encoding.

</p>
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_7">Views / Rules</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically create rules on views so they are updateable, per SQL99
<p>  We can only auto-create rules for simple views.  For more complex
  cases users will still have to write rules manually.
  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-03/msg00586.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-03/msg00586.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Add the functionality for WITH CHECK OPTION clause of CREATE VIEW
  </li><li>Allow NOTIFY in rules involving conditionals
  </li><li>Allow VIEW/RULE recompilation when the underlying tables change
<p>  Another issue is whether underlying table changes should be reflected
  in the view, e.g. should SELECT * show additional columns if they
  are added after the view is created.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_8">SQL Commands</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Add CORRESPONDING BY to UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
  </li><li>Add ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS options to GROUP BY
  </li><li>%Allow SET CONSTRAINTS to be qualified by schema/table name
  </li><li>%Add a separate TRUNCATE permission
<p>  Currently only the owner can TRUNCATE a table because triggers are not
  called, and the table is locked in exclusive mode.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow PREPARE of cursors
  </li><li>Allow finer control over the caching of prepared query plans
<p>  Currently, queries prepared via the libpq API are planned on first
  execute using the supplied parameters --- allow SQL PREPARE to do the
  same.  Also, allow control over replanning prepared queries either
  manually or automatically when statistics for execute parameters
  differ dramatically from those used during planning.
</p>
  </li><li>Invalidate prepared queries, like INSERT, when the table definition
  is altered
  </li><li>Allow LISTEN/NOTIFY to store info in memory rather than tables?
<p>  Currently LISTEN/NOTIFY information is stored in pg_listener. Storing
  such information in memory would improve performance.
</p>
  </li><li>Add optional textual message to NOTIFY
<p>  This would allow an informational message to be added to the notify
  message, perhaps indicating the row modified or other custom
  information.
</p>
  </li><li>Add a GUC variable to warn about non-standard SQL usage in queries
  </li><li>Add SQL-standard MERGE command, typically used to merge two tables
  [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?merge">merge</a>]
<p>  This is similar to UPDATE, then for unmatched rows, INSERT.
  Whether concurrent access allows modifications which could cause
  row loss is implementation independent.
</p>
  </li><li>Add REPLACE or UPSERT command that does UPDATE, or on failure, INSERT
  [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?merge">merge</a>]
<p>  To implement this cleanly requires that the table have a unique index
  so duplicate checking can be easily performed.  It is possible to
  do it without a unique index if we require the user to LOCK the table
  before the MERGE.
</p>
  </li><li>Add NOVICE output level for helpful messages like automatic sequence/index
  creation
  </li><li>Add RESET CONNECTION command to reset all session state
<p>  This would include resetting of all variables (RESET ALL), dropping of
  temporary tables, removing any NOTIFYs, cursors, open transactions,
  prepared queries, currval()s, etc.  This could be used  for connection
  pooling.  We could also change RESET ALL to have this functionality.  
  The difficult of this features is allowing RESET ALL to not affect 
  changes made by the interface driver for its internal use.  One idea 
  is for this to be a protocol-only feature.  Another approach is to 
  notify the protocol when a RESET CONNECTION command is used.

</p>
  </li><li>Add GUC to issue notice about statements that use unjoined tables
  </li><li>Allow EXPLAIN to identify tables that were skipped because of 
  constraint_exclusion
  </li><li>Allow EXPLAIN output to be more easily processed by scripts
  </li><li>Enable standard_conforming_strings
  </li><li>Make standard_conforming_strings the default in 8.3?
<p>  When this is done, backslash-quote should be prohibited in non-E''
  strings because of possible confusion over how such strings treat
  backslashes.  Basically, '' is always safe for a literal single
  quote, while \' might or might not be based on the backslash
  handling rules.
</p>
  </li><li>Simplify dropping roles that have objects in several databases
  </li><li>Allow COMMENT ON to accept an expression rather than just a string
  </li><li>Allow the count returned by SELECT, etc to be to represent as an int64
  to allow a higher range of values
  </li><li>Make CLUSTER preserve recently-dead tuples per MVCC requirements
  </li><li>Add SQL99 WITH clause to SELECT
  </li><li>Add SQL:2003 WITH RECURSIVE (hierarchical) queries to SELECT
  </li><li>Add DEFAULT .. AS OWNER so permission checks are done as the table
  owner
<p>  This would be useful for SERIAL nextval() calls and CHECK constraints.
</p>
  </li><li>Add a GUC to control whether BEGIN inside a transcation should abort
  the transaction.
  </li><li>Allow DISTINCT to work in multiple-argument aggregate calls
  </li><li>Add column to pg_stat_activity that shows the progress of long-running
  commands like CREATE INDEX and VACUUM
  </li><li>Implement SQL:2003 window functions
  </li><li>CREATE
  <ul>
    <li>Allow CREATE TABLE AS to determine column lengths for complex
          expressions like SELECT col1 || col2
    </li><li>Use more reliable method for CREATE DATABASE to get a consistent
          copy of db?
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>UPDATE
  <ul>
    <li>Allow UPDATE tab SET ROW (col, ...) = (SELECT...)

</p>
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>ALTER
  <ul>
    <li>%Have ALTER TABLE RENAME rename SERIAL sequence names
    </li><li>Add ALTER DOMAIN to modify the underlying data type
    </li><li>%Allow ALTER TABLE ... ALTER CONSTRAINT ... RENAME
<p>          <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-02/msg00168.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-02/msg00168.php</a>
</p>
    </li><li>%Allow ALTER TABLE to change constraint deferrability and actions
    </li><li>Add missing object types for ALTER ... SET SCHEMA
    </li><li>Allow ALTER TABLESPACE to move to different directories
    </li><li>Allow databases to be moved to different tablespaces
    </li><li>Allow moving system tables to other tablespaces, where possible
<p>          Currently non-global system tables must be in the default database
          tablespace. Global system tables can never be moved.
</p>
    </li><li>Prevent parent tables from altering or dropping constraints
          like CHECK that are inherited by child tables unless CASCADE
          is used
    </li><li>%Prevent child tables from altering or dropping constraints
          like CHECK that were inherited from the parent table
    </li><li>Have ALTER INDEX update the name of a constraint using that index
    </li><li>Add ALTER TABLE RENAME CONSTRAINT, update index name also
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>CLUSTER
  <ul>
    <li>Automatically maintain clustering on a table
<p>          This might require some background daemon to maintain clustering
          during periods of low usage. It might also require tables to be only
          partially filled for easier reorganization.  Another idea would
          be to create a merged heap/index data file so an index lookup would
          automatically access the heap data too.  A third idea would be to
          store heap rows in hashed groups, perhaps using a user-supplied
          hash function.
          <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2004-08/msg00349.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-performance/2004-08/msg00349.php</a>
</p>
    </li><li>%Add default clustering to system tables
<p>          To do this, determine the ideal cluster index for each system
          table and set the cluster setting during initdb.
</p>
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>COPY
  <ul>
    <li>Allow COPY to report error lines and continue
<p>          This requires the use of a savepoint before each COPY line is
          processed, with ROLLBACK on COPY failure.
</p>
    </li><li>Allow COPY on a newly-created table to skip WAL logging
<p>          On crash recovery, the table involved in the COPY would
          be removed or have its heap and index files truncated.  One
          issue is that no other backend should be able to add to 
          the table at the same time, which is something that is 
          currently allowed.
</p>
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>GRANT/REVOKE
  <ul>
    <li>Allow column-level privileges
    </li><li>%Allow GRANT/REVOKE permissions to be applied to all schema objects
          with one command
<p>          The proposed syntax is:
</p><p>                GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN public TO phpuser;
                GRANT SELECT ON NEW TABLES IN public TO phpuser;
</p>
    </li><li>Allow GRANT/REVOKE permissions to be inherited by objects based on
          schema permissions
    </li><li>Allow SERIAL sequences to inherit permissions from the base table?
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>CURSOR
  <ul>
    <li>Allow UPDATE/DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF cursor
<p>          This requires using the row ctid to map cursor rows back to the
          original heap row. This become more complicated if WITH HOLD cursors
          are to be supported because WITH HOLD cursors have a copy of the row
          and no FOR UPDATE lock.
</p>
    </li><li>Prevent DROP TABLE from dropping a row referenced by its own open
          cursor?
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>INSERT
  <ul>
    <li>Allow INSERT/UPDATE of the system-generated oid value for a row
    </li><li>In rules, allow VALUES() to contain a mixture of 'old' and 'new'
          references
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>SHOW/SET
  <ul>
    <li>Add SET PERFORMANCE_TIPS option to suggest INDEX, VACUUM, VACUUM
          ANALYZE, and CLUSTER
    </li><li>Add SET PATH for schemas?
<p>          This is basically the same as SET search_path.
</p>
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Referential Integrity
  <ul>
    <li>Add MATCH PARTIAL referential integrity
    </li><li>Change foreign key constraint for array -&gt; element to mean element
          in array?
    </li><li>Enforce referential integrity for system tables
    </li><li>Fix problem when cascading referential triggers make changes on
          cascaded tables, seeing the tables in an intermediate state

</p>
    </li><li>Allow DEFERRABLE and end-of-statement UNIQUE constraints?
<p>          This would allow UPDATE tab SET col = col + 1 to work if col has
          a unique index.  Currently, uniqueness checks are done while the
          command is being executed, rather than at the end of the statement
          or transaction.

      </li><li>Add Oracle-style packages  (Pavel)
<p>                  A package would be a schema with session-local variables,
                  public/private functions, and initialization functions.  It
                  is also possible to implement these capabilities
                  in all schemas and not use a separate "packages"
                  syntax at all.

<h1><a name="section_9">Clients</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Have pg_ctl look at PGHOST in case it is a socket directory?
  </li><li>Allow pg_ctl to work properly with configuration files located outside
  the PGDATA directory
<p>  pg_ctl can not read the pid file because it isn't located in the
  config directory but in the PGDATA directory.  The solution is to
  allow pg_ctl to read and understand postgresql.conf to find the
  data_directory value.
</p>
  </li><li>psql
  <ul>
    <li>Have psql show current values for a sequence
    </li><li>Move psql backslash database information into the backend, use
          mnemonic commands? [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?psql">psql</a>]
<p>          This would allow non-psql clients to pull the same information out
          of the database as psql.
</p>
    </li><li>Fix psql's \d commands more consistent

    </li><li>Consistently display privilege information for all objects in psql
    </li><li>Add auto-expanded mode so expanded output is used if the row
          length is wider than the screen width.  
<p>          Consider using auto-expanded mode for backslash commands like \df+.
</p>
    </li><li>Prevent tab completion of SET TRANSACTION from querying the
          database and therefore preventing the transaction isolation
          level from being set.
<p>          Currently, SET &lt;tab&gt; causes a database lookup to check all
          supported session variables.  This query causes problems
          because setting the transaction isolation level must be the
          first statement of a transaction.

<p>          PQfnumber() should never have been doing lowercasing, but 
          historically it has so we need a way to prevent it
</p>
    </li><li>Allow statement results to be automatically batched to the client
<p>          Currently, all statement results are transferred to the libpq
          client before libpq makes the results available to the 
          application.  This feature would allow the application to make
          use of the first result rows while the rest are transferred, or
          held on the server waiting for them to be requested by libpq.
          One complexity is that a statement like SELECT 1/col could error
          out mid-way through the result set.

<h1><a name="section_10">Triggers</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Add deferred trigger queue file
<p>  Right now all deferred trigger information is stored in backend
  memory.  This could exhaust memory for very large trigger queues.
  This item involves dumping large queues into files.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow triggers to be disabled in only the current session.
<p>  This is currently possible by starting a multi-statement transaction,
  modifying the system tables, performing the desired SQL, restoring the
  system tables, and committing the transaction.  ALTER TABLE ...
  TRIGGER requires a table lock so it is not ideal for this usage.
</p>
  </li><li>With disabled triggers, allow pg_dump to use ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY
<p>  If the dump is known to be valid, allow foreign keys to be added
  without revalidating the data.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow statement-level triggers to access modified rows
  </li><li>Support triggers on columns
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-07/msg00107.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-07/msg00107.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Allow AFTER triggers on system tables
<p>  System tables are modified in many places in the backend without going
  through the executor and therefore not causing triggers to fire. To
  complete this item, the functions that modify system tables will have
  to fire triggers.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_11">Dependency Checking</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Flush cached query plans when the dependent objects change,
  when the cardinality of parameters changes dramatically, or
  when new ANALYZE statistics are available
<p>  A more complex solution would be to save multiple plans for different
  cardinality and use the appropriate plan based on the EXECUTE values.
</p>
  </li><li>Track dependencies in function bodies and recompile/invalidate
<p>  This is particularly important for references to temporary tables
  in PL/PgSQL because PL/PgSQL caches query plans.  The only workaround
  in PL/PgSQL is to use EXECUTE.  One complexity is that a function
  might itself drop and recreate dependent tables, causing it to
  invalidate its own query plan.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_12">Indexes</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Allow inherited tables to inherit index, UNIQUE constraint, and primary
  key, foreign key
  </li><li>UNIQUE INDEX on base column not honored on INSERTs/UPDATEs from
  inherited table:  INSERT INTO inherit_table (unique_index_col) VALUES
  (dup) should fail
<p>  The main difficulty with this item is the problem of creating an index
  that can span more than one table.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on inherited tables
  </li><li>Add UNIQUE capability to non-btree indexes
  </li><li>Prevent index uniqueness checks when UPDATE does not modify the column
<p>  Uniqueness (index) checks are done when updating a column even if the
  column is not modified by the UPDATE.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow the creation of on-disk bitmap indexes which can be quickly
  combined with other bitmap indexes
<p>  Such indexes could be more compact if there are only a few distinct values.
  Such indexes can also be compressed.  Keeping such indexes updated can be
  costly.
  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-07/msg00512.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2005-07/msg00512.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Allow use of indexes to search for NULLs
<p>  One solution is to create a partial index on an IS NULL expression.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow accurate statistics to be collected on indexes with more than
  one column or expression indexes, perhaps using per-index statistics
  </li><li>Allow the creation of indexes with mixed ascending/descending
  specifiers
<p>  This is possible now by creating an operator class with reversed sort
  operators.  One complexity is that NULLs would then appear at the start
  of the result set, and this might affect certain sort types, like
  merge join.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow constraint_exclusion to work for UNIONs like it does for
  inheritance, allow it to work for UPDATE and DELETE statements, and allow
  it to be used for all statements with little performance impact
  </li><li>Allow CREATE INDEX to take an additional parameter for use with
  special index types
  </li><li>Consider compressing indexes by storing key values duplicated in
  several rows as a single index entry
<p>  This is difficult because it requires datatype-specific knowledge.
</p>
  </li><li>GIST
  <ul>
    <li>Add more GIST index support for geometric data types
    </li><li>Allow GIST indexes to create certain complex index types, like
          digital trees (see Aoki)
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Hash
  <ul>
    <li>Pack hash index buckets onto disk pages more efficiently
<p>          Currently only one hash bucket can be stored on a page. Ideally
          several hash buckets could be stored on a single page and greater
          granularity used for the hash algorithm.
</p>

<h1><a name="section_14">Cache Usage</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Allow free-behind capability for large sequential scans, perhaps using
  posix_fadvise()
<p>  Posix_fadvise() can control both sequential/random file caching and
  free-behind behavior, but it is unclear how the setting affects other
  backends that also have the file open, and the feature is not supported
  on all operating systems.
</p>
  </li><li>Speed up COUNT(*)
<p>  We could use a fixed row count and a +/- count to follow MVCC
  visibility rules, or a single cached value could be used and
  invalidated if anyone modifies the table.  Another idea is to
  get a count directly from a unique index, but for this to be
  faster than a sequential scan it must avoid access to the heap
  to obtain tuple visibility information.
</p>
  </li><li>Add estimated_count(*) to return an estimate of COUNT(*)
<p>  This would use the planner ANALYZE statistics to return an estimated
  count.
  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-11/msg00943.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-11/msg00943.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Allow data to be pulled directly from indexes
<p>  Currently indexes do not have enough tuple visibility information 
  to allow data to be pulled from the index without also accessing 
  the heap.  One way to allow this is to set a bit on index tuples 
  to indicate if a tuple is currently visible to all transactions 
  when the first valid heap lookup happens.  This bit would have to 
  be cleared when a heap tuple is expired.  
</p>
<p>  Another idea is to maintain a bitmap of heap pages where all rows
  are visible to all backends, and allow index lookups to reference 
  that bitmap to avoid heap lookups, perhaps the same bitmap we might
  add someday to determine which heap pages need vacuuming.  Frequently
  accessed bitmaps would have to be stored in shared memory.  One 8k
  page of bitmaps could track 512MB of heap pages.
</p>
  </li><li>Consider automatic caching of statements at various levels:
  <ul>
    <li>Parsed query tree
    </li><li>Query execute plan
    </li><li>Query results
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Allow sequential scans to take advantage of other concurrent
  sequential scans, also called "Synchronised Scanning"
<p>  One possible implementation is to start sequential scans from the lowest
  numbered buffer in the shared cache, and when reaching the end wrap
  around to the beginning, rather than always starting sequential scans
  at the start of the table.
</p>
  </li><li>Consider increasing internal areas when shared buffers is increased

<h1><a name="section_15">Vacuum</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Improve speed with indexes
<p>  For large table adjustments during VACUUM FULL, it is faster to 
  reindex rather than update the index.
</p>
  </li><li>Reduce lock time during VACUUM FULL by moving tuples with read lock,
  then write lock and truncate table
<p>  Moved tuples are invisible to other backends so they don't require a
  write lock. However, the read lock promotion to write lock could lead
  to deadlock situations.
</p>
  </li><li>Auto-fill the free space map by scanning the buffer cache or by
  checking pages written by the background writer
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-02/msg01125.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-02/msg01125.php</a>

</p>
  </li><li>Create a bitmap of pages that need vacuuming
<p>  Instead of sequentially scanning the entire table, have the background
  writer or some other process record pages that have expired rows, then
  VACUUM can look at just those pages rather than the entire table.  In
  the event of a system crash, the bitmap would probably be invalidated.
  One complexity is that index entries still have to be vacuumed, and
  doing this without an index scan (by using the heap values to find the
  index entry) might be slow and unreliable, especially for user-defined
  index functions.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow FSM to return free space toward the beginning of the heap file,
  in hopes that empty pages at the end can be truncated by VACUUM
  </li><li>Allow FSM page return free space based on table clustering, to assist
  in maintaining clustering?
  </li><li>Consider shrinking expired tuples to just their headers
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-03/msg00142.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-03/msg00142.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Allow heap reuse of UPDATEd rows if no indexed columns are changed,
  and old and new versions are on the same heap page?
<p>  While vacuum handles DELETEs fine, updating of non-indexed columns, like
  counters, are difficult for VACUUM to handle efficiently.  This method
  is possible for same-page updates because a single index row can be
  used to point to both old and new values.

<h1><a name="section_17">Startup Time Improvements</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Experiment with multi-threaded backend for backend creation [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?thread">thread</a>]
<p>  This would prevent the overhead associated with process creation. Most
  operating systems have trivial process creation time compared to
  database startup overhead, but a few operating systems (Win32,
  Solaris) might benefit from threading.  Also explore the idea of
  a single session using multiple threads to execute a statement faster.
</p>
  </li><li>Experiment with multi-threaded backend better resource utilization
<p>  This would allow a single query to make use of multiple CPU's or
  multiple I/O channels simultaneously.  One idea is to create a
  background reader that can pre-fetch sequential and index scan
  pages needed by other backends.  This could be expanded to allow
  concurrent reads from multiple devices in a partitioned table.
</p>
  </li><li>Add connection pooling
<p>  It is unclear if this should be done inside the backend code or done
  by something external like pgpool. The passing of file descriptors to
  existing backends is one of the difficulties with a backend approach.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_18">Write-Ahead Log</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminate need to write full pages to WAL before page modification [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?wal">wal</a>]
<p>  Currently, to protect against partial disk page writes, we write
  full page images to WAL before they are modified so we can correct any
  partial page writes during recovery.  These pages can also be
  eliminated from point-in-time archive files.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When off, write CRC to WAL and check file system blocks
           on recovery
<p>           If CRC check fails during recovery, remember the page in case
           a later CRC for that page properly matches.
</p>
    </li><li>Write full pages during file system write and not when
           the page is modified in the buffer cache
<p>           This allows most full page writes to happen in the background
           writer.  It might cause problems for applying WAL on recovery
           into a partially-written page, but later the full page will be
           replaced from WAL.
</p>
  </li></ul>
  </li><li>Allow WAL traffic to be streamed to another server for stand-by
  replication
  </li><li>Reduce WAL traffic so only modified values are written rather than
  entire rows?
  </li><li>Allow the pg_xlog directory location to be specified during initdb
  with a symlink back to the /data location
  </li><li>Allow WAL information to recover corrupted pg_controldata
<p>  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-06/msg00025.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-patches/2006-06/msg00025.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Find a way to reduce rotational delay when repeatedly writing
  last WAL page
<p>  Currently fsync of WAL requires the disk platter to perform a full
  rotation to fsync again. One idea is to write the WAL to different
  offsets that might reduce the rotational delay.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow buffered WAL writes and fsync
<p>  Instead of guaranteeing recovery of all committed transactions, this
  would provide improved performance by delaying WAL writes and fsync
  so an abrupt operating system restart might lose a few seconds of
  committed transactions but still be consistent.  We could perhaps
  remove the 'fsync' parameter (which results in an an inconsistent
  database) in favor of this capability.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow WAL logging to be turned off for a table, but the table
  might be dropped or truncated during crash recovery [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?walcontrol">walcontrol</a>]
<p>  Allow tables to bypass WAL writes and just fsync() dirty pages on
  commit.  This should be implemented using ALTER TABLE, e.g. ALTER 
  TABLE PERSISTENCE [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo? DROP | TRUNCATE | DEFAULT "> DROP | TRUNCATE | DEFAULT </a>].  Tables using 
  non-default logging should not use referential integrity with 
  default-logging tables.  A table without dirty buffers during a
  crash could perhaps avoid the drop/truncate.
</p>
  </li><li>Allow WAL logging to be turned off for a table, but the table would
  avoid being truncated/dropped [<a href="http://momjian.postgresql.org/cgi-bin/pgtodo?walcontrol">walcontrol</a>]
<p>  To do this, only a single writer can modify the table, and writes 
  must happen only on new pages so the new pages can be removed during
  crash recovery.  Readers can continue accessing the table.  Such 
  tables probably cannot have indexes.  One complexity is the handling 
  of indexes on TOAST tables.

<p>  Right now, if no index exists, ORDER BY ... LIMIT # requires we sort

  sequential scan to find the high/low value, thus avoiding the sort.
  MIN/MAX already does this, but not for LIMIT &gt; 1.

</li></ul>
<h1><a name="section_20">Miscellaneous Performance</a></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Do async I/O for faster random read-ahead of data
<p>  Async I/O allows multiple I/O requests to be sent to the disk with
  results coming back asynchronously.
  <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00820.php">http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2006-10/msg00820.php</a>
</p>
  </li><li>Use mmap() rather than SYSV shared memory or to write WAL files?
<p>  This would remove the requirement for SYSV SHM but would introduce
  portability issues. Anonymous mmap (or mmap to /dev/zero) is required
  to prevent I/O overhead.
</p>
  </li><li>Consider mmap()'ing files into a backend?
<p>  Doing I/O to large tables would consume a lot of address space or
  require frequent mapping/unmapping.  Extending the file also causes
  mapping problems that might require mapping only individual pages,
  leading to thousands of mappings.  Another problem is that there is no
  way to <u>prevent</u> I/O to disk from the dirty shared buffers so changes
  could hit disk before WAL is written.
</p>
  </li><li>Add a script to ask system configuration questions and tune postgresql.conf
  </li><li>Merge xmin/xmax/cmin/cmax back into three header fields
<p>  Before subtransactions, there used to be only three fields needed to
  store these four values. This was possible because only the current
  transaction looks at the cmin/cmax values. If the current transaction
  created and expired the row the fields stored where xmin (same as
  xmax), cmin, cmax, and if the transaction was expiring a row from a
  another transaction, the fields stored were xmin (cmin was not
  needed), xmax, and cmax. Such a system worked because a transaction
  could only see rows from another completed transaction. However,
  subtransactions can see rows from outer transactions, and once the
  subtransaction completes, the outer transaction continues, requiring
  the storage of all four fields. With subtransactions, an outer
  transaction can create a row, a subtransaction expire it, and when the
  subtransaction completes, the outer transaction still has to have
  proper visibility of the row's cmin, for example, for cursors.
</p>
<p>  One possible solution is to create a phantom cid which represents a
  cmin/cmax pair and is stored in local memory.  Another idea is to
  store both cmin and cmax only in local memory.
</p>
  </li><li>Consider ways of storing rows more compactly on disk
  <ul>
    <li>Support a smaller header for short variable-length fields?
<p>          One idea is to create zero-or-one-byte-header versions 
          of varlena data types.  In involves setting the high-bit and 
          0-127 length in the single-byte header, or clear the high bit
          and store the 7-bit ASCII value in the rest of the byte.
          The small-header versions have no alignment requirements.
