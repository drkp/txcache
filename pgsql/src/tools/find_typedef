# This script attempts to find all typedef's in the postgres binaries

# 
# For this program to work, you must have compiled all binaries with 
# debugging symbols.
#
# This is run on BSD/OS 4.0, so you may need to make changes.
# 
# Ignore the nm errors about a file not being a binary file.
#
# Remember, debugging symbols are your friends.
